# clj-discord

## Clojure library for using the Discord API

This is a very minimalist library, but if you just want to build a simple bot 
that reacts to certain commands and events by sending chat messages, it should be sufficient.

## To use this library:

1. clone this repository
2. do `lein install`
3. add to your project dependencies `[clj-discord "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]`
4. add to your namespace declaration `(:require [clj-discord.core :as discord])`
5. have a look at the code in the namespace clj-discord.example
